# Bovitrack-System
# Function 1 - Behavioral Detection
The project aims to analyze cow behavior (eating, lying, standing) from live video streams using a 
machine learning and identify cow's HEAT detection using smart device, providing real-time insights to improve livestock management and welfare.
it can be divided in two parts.

Identifying the HEAT of cattle using electronic mount detector early and directing them to breeding at the right time.
Cattle behavior monitor for HEAT detection

• Identifying the HEAT of cattle using electronic mount 
  detector early and directing them to breeding at the right 
  time.
  
Cow Behavior Analysis Using YOLO
• analyze cow behavior (eating, lying, standing) from live 
  video streams using a machine learning, providing real-time insights.
