1. Dynamic Video Resolution Adjustment Algorithm
   
• Purpose: This algorithm dynamically adjusts video resolution based on the available internet speed to optimize video processing for the YOLO model. It ensures efficient resource utilization while balancing video quality and realtime object detection capabilities.

• Relevance: This is a supportive function for the YOLO-based behavior detection model, enabling seamless integration even under varying network conditions. 

2. Frame Rate Reduction Algorithm for Live Streaming
   
• Purpose: This algorithm intelligently reduces the frame rate of live streamed videos to optimize bandwidth usage while preserving essential visual information. It balances the trade-off between smooth streaming and data transmission efficiency. 

• Relevance: By lowering the frame rate when necessary, this algorithm ensures uninterrupted live streaming of farm activities, even in low bandwidth scenarios.

3. Video Quality Prediction Model – (ML Model: Random Forest classifier )
   
• Purpose: This machine learning model predicts the video quality (e.g., HD, Full HD, 4K) based on real-time streaming conditions, such as network speed and hardware capabilities. It proactively adjusts the video quality to deliver the best possible viewing experience. 

• Relevance: Integrated into the live-streaming functionality, this model enhances the user experience by dynamically adapting to streaming conditions, ensuring clear and uninterrupted monitoring of farm activities.
